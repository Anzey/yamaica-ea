Related to:
	- GLIPCI-307 (repeated Franca2UML import duplicates UML contents)
	- GLIPCI-417 (Successive import of fidls to EA must work)

Goal: Exporting any Franca package (e.g. MGU-Ausleitung) to EA and backwards mutliple times successivly.

TODO/SET:
	- FRANCA_DIR				: Folder of the Franca package
	- YAMAICA_HOME				: Folder of the Yamaica console
	- EA_MasterCatalog.eap		: Master Catalog merges at least one Domain Catalog with any amount of FIDL imports
	- nv flag					: Disabled

Nice to have: Store log files as well!
